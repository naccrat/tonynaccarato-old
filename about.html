              <h1>About me</h1> 
              <p>I'm a user experience designer that follows a user-centered design process to better understand real users—their needs, experiences, and motivations. I approach design from a user-perspective and balance users’ needs alongside business goals and technical capabilities. I work closely with product managers and developers to determine necessary features and drive the design of products. I have experience conducting user research, extracting requirements, designing an interaction framework, iterating, and presenting ideas to development and management.</p>
              <p>When I'm not designing I love being with my wife and four kids. I enjoy the concerts and sporting events that all my children are involved with. I love to travel and experience different cultures.</p>

            <h2>How I came to be a UX Designer</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>I went to Weber State University and got a BFA in Visual Communication and Design in 2005. While at school I was able to work at a traditional offset printing facility prepping files for printing. I also worked for the university bookstore helping design their website. My goal at this point was to be a graphic designer for a well know ad agency.</p>
            <p>After graduating I started working for a company called Logoworks. For about a year I created logos and stationary sets for clients. I then was asked to be the designer for the marketing team at the company. This gave me the opportunity to really be focused on one area and work more on the web. In addition to designing some really fun printed marketing pieces, I also worked on a lot of website landing page and the companies main website. This also gave me more skills in front-end development that I had started to learn at the university bookstore. This opportunity really opened my eyes to usability and making sure I designed things that were easy for people to use.</p>
            <p>I realized that I wanted to do more design based on usability which lead me to my next job working for 3point5. Here I had the chance to work with a lot of great outdoor/sporting brands and create training websites for them. This gave me an understanding of how to work with business requirements but design something that was unique and easy for users to understand. At this company, I had the chance to work with a new product they were building and was in charge of the overall design and user experience. I had the chance to work with researchers and understand more about the user-centric approach to designing. This experience lead me to my next opportunity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>I started working as an interaction designer for a worldwide organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was one of over 50 interaction designers in this group and had the chance to start working on some challenging internal applications. Through this experience, I was able to design applications that would be translated into 12 languages. This gave me to chance to realize the power of user testing and iterating while working closely with the clients we were building for.</p>
            <p>My next opportunity was being a user experience designer for Workfront, formerly known as AtTast. This opportunity expanded my knowledge of user experience design with user testing, customer inquiries, and many tools to help document and understand the user journey. I was able to deepen my understanding of a product organization and how a user experience focus really made a better product. At this point in my career, I wanted to apply what I have learned to a product that I was more passionate about. This lead me to a company called Pluralsight.</p>
            <p>Pluralsight’s mission is to give technology skills to everyone. This was something I was able to get behind and knew it would be an opportunity to take what I have learned and be able to build on top of that. The company adopted a user-centric philosophy called Directed Discover. This allowed each team in the company to take time and resources to discover the best solution for the users. The projects I was working on are very complex, multi-phase content management systems. This has helped the company be able to have better resource allocation and produce content much quicker, saving thousands of dollars each month. I’ve been able to efficiently work with remote teams and learn the best ways to communicate across cultures and time zones.</p>
